# How to run this code once pulled

Make sure you have installed yarn,
[install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)


## Install yarn in the frontend folder
### `yarn install`

## Then, run yarn to launch the CA3 frontend
### `yarn start`

## Got an error?
Delete:
* node_modules folder,
* "lock" files 
* tsconfig.json 

Then run the install and start commands again, might take a moment, it is reinstalling the packages used.
